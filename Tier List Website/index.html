            What is a tier list?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Tier Lists are rankings of playable characters in a variety of video games based on their performance within the highest level of play, typically in competitive tournaments. The lists weigh the abilities of each character against the rest of the playable cast and ranks them under the assumption that each is controlled by equally skilled players. However, since the rise of these types of lists within gaming communities, they have been used as modes of parody, criticism and jokes, ranking non-video game-related subjects, as well. These lists generally follow the designations "Top Tier," "Mid Tier" and "Low Tier"

            TierZoo is an "edutainment" YouTuber who specializes in teaching about animals and their roles in habitats using Tier List parodies categorizing the animals as if they were class builds and planet Earth was an MMORPG.<br><br>
            Along with the example above, there are many different kinds of tier lists. There can be a tier list about food, drinks, tv characters, anime characters, etc.<br><br>
            Here is an exmaple of a tier list template:
