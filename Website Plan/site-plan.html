        Why will people come to your site? <br>
        People will come to my site because they want to either learn about their friends, to settle a dispute, or create an official ranking. They will also come to learn more about tier lists. These “rankings” can be just about anything. Page 2 and Page 3 will have a fast-food tier list and a soft drink tier list. These are just examples set up for the public. These tier lists can be just about anything, bands, music genres, video games, etc. This page is solely informational and descriptive. It will explain a little but about tier lists, like where did they come from and who invented them. <br> <br>

        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? <br>
        What is a tier list? <br>
        How do tier lists work/How do I use a tier list? <br>
        Who invested tier lists? <br>
        Why are tier lists helpful? <br>
        What do tier lists solve? <br> <br>

        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site? <br>
        All visitors will want to complete a tier list, by dragging and dropping photos into their respective tiers. either by themselves or discussing it with others or their friends.  <br> <br>

        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? <br>
        For my website in particular, visitors and users will need to be able to differentiate and know of different fast-food restaurants and soft drinks. All other information will be provided to them, like instructions and the tier lists themselves. <br> <br>

        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? <br>
        Visitors and users will come to my site because of the large quantity of items within the tier lists provided so that they are able to express their thoughts about obscure fast-food chains and soft drinks. <br> <br>
        
        About the idea and website: <br>
        I have had a lot of experience with tier lists in the past. I have created some with my friends, which got us very fired up. Some discussions turned into serious friendship-determining topics! As we created the tier lists, we found that the most enjoyed and controversial was fast-food and soft drinks. Everyone had a different opinion, which made it so intriguing. I also watched some people make their own on different websites like YouTube, and Twitch. As I watched these tier list rankings, I saw the chat and comments explode in discussion. Everyone seemed to have a different take on the subject. When I was watching another tier list video online, I had the thought to give my own take on my own tier list website. I really like to make new and cool websites, so I thought it would be fun. I wanted to create a tier list website with my favorite topics to discuss - fast-food and soft drinks. Many other tier list websites didn't have all the discreet and unknown fast-food chains and soft drinks, which was an issue for me and my friends. I hope to bring an enjoyable experience that is smooth and easy to follow so that many people and their friends are able to enjoy each other's company by discussing their favorite and not-so-favorite things!
